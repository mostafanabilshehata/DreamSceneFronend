# Required Images for Subcategory Pages

Please add the following images to the `src/assets/images/` directory:

## Costumes Category Images:
1. **men-costumes.jpg** - Image representing men's costumes/clothing
2. **women-costumes.jpg** - Image representing women's costumes/clothing
3. **kids-costumes.jpg** - Image representing kids' costumes/clothing

## Decor Category Images:
1. **backdrop.jpg** - Image representing backdrop decorations
2. **leg.jpg** - Image representing leg decorations

---

## Temporary Workaround:
Until you add these images, you can:
1. Use placeholder images from the existing assets
2. Or modify the subcategory.component.ts to use existing images temporarily

Example modification in subcategory.component.ts:
- Replace image paths with: `'assets/images/hero.png'` or any existing image
